# video_game_reviews_and_sales
Small project where I analyze reviews of video games from 1977-2020 and their publishers to see if there is any trend. Data used courtesy of https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata . There isn't much in the way of a conclusion in this project, but it does make for a fun little infographic about video games throughout most of their existence.
